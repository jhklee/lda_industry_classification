# Lda industry classification

This page is a code repositary for industry classification using LDA.

We explore industry classifications using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We propose a text-based industry classification using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling by extracting distinguishable features from business descriptions in financial reports. The proposed method generates topics of the entire financial reports text data and assign the best topic that matches each company. Then we could cluster companies within the same topics. The method also enables human interpretation of the clustered result. Terms that compose topics are probabilistically returned. Through those probabilistic terms, we could define the new industry classification results more specifically and efficiently.
